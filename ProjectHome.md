Please note that the members of this project are not the authors of Jmorph.
We're using Jmorph in our Hunglish (http://code.google.com/p/hunglish-webapp/) project.
The Jmorph source is no more available on the original Jmorph project page, that's why we published this here, to make sure the Hunglish project does not have any dependency lacking source.

The author of Jmorph is Gy√∂rgy Gyepesi http://hu.linkedin.com/pub/gy%C3%B6rgy-gyepesi/5/344/9b4
